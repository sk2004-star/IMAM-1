            <label for="faq4">Does Intrepid have family trips?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Intrepid offers a wide range of Family Adventures around the globe. The 
				minimum age (for Family trips) varies depending on the destination, and 
				Intrepid has set minimum ages to ensure that the included activities suit 
				each age range. Additionally, you’ll notice that some of the more 
				adventurous destinations have a higher minimum age. Please check out our 
				Family Adventures for more information.</p>

            <label for="faq5">How many people will be on my trip?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Good things come in small packages, which is why we keep our group sizes
				down. This means we’re small enough to remain flexible as we thread our way
				through communities without intimidating the locals. On most of our trips 
				you’ll be part of an intimate group of 12-16 people, though our group sizes
				are on average 10 people. Our Overland trips are in purpose-built vehicles 
				that can carry up to 24 travellers. Group sizes are displayed on each trip’s
				overview page on our website.</p>

            <label for="faq6">Can I make any changes to the itinerary of my group trip, either before or during the trip?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Please make sure you are happy with your group trip itinerary before book
				ing because we are unable to change them for individual travellers. However,
				if you and a group of friends, colleagues or even your school would like 
				your own personally designed itinerary, get in contact with our very 
				talented Tailor-Made team; they can tailor an itinerary just for you.</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="faq7">
            <label for="faq7">Are there age restrictions on your trips?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>For the majority of our trips the minimum age is 15. An adult must 
				accompany all children under the age of 18. Our Overland Adventures have a 
				minimum age of 18. Younger children can join us on our Family trips and 
				Short Break Adventures, but check each trip for its minimum age, which is 
				located on the trip’s overview page on the website. Most of our trips don’t 
				have a maximum age limit, but a Self-Assessment Form is required for all 
				travellers 70 years and over.</p>

            <input type="checkbox" id="faq8">
            <label for="faq8">How do you arrange room sharing on the trip and who will I have to share with?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>On our trips rooms are assigned on a twin-share basis. We pair up solo 
				travellers with another traveller of the same gender as per the gender 
				marker on each of their passports. If you'd like your own space, you also 
				have the choice to pay for an individual room (available on the majority of 
				our trips).</p>

				<p>As a responsible tour operator, we strive to create a safe and inclusive 
				environment for everyone. In the case that your gender identity differs 
				from what is indicated on your passport, please contact us so that we can 
				discuss rooming options with you.</p>

				<p>On a small selection of itineraries some accommodations are booked on an 
				open-gender, multi-share basis (for example on a felucca in Egypt or an over
				night train in Vietnam). In those instances, it will clearly be stated in 
				your trip’s Essential Trip Information prior to booking and travelling.</p>

            <label for="faq9">I'm travelling with a partner, can I make sure we have a double bed?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>If you’re travelling with a partner, just let us know you want to share 
				a room (and a bed) at the time of booking. We can’t guarantee a double bed,
				but we’ll do our best to accommodate you. In some destinations, the option 
				may be two single beds pushed together to form a ‘double’.</p>

            <label for="faq10">What will the food be like on my trip?</label>
            <div class="content">
                <p>Food is one of the most exciting parts of travel. There may be some 
				familiar fare but often you’ll be confronted with the new, interesting and 
				downright weird of the culinary world but we like to think of it as an 
				adventure for all the senses. In addition to this, our flexible itineraries
				often allow you to eat with the group or branch out on your own - this means
				you can eat to suit any budget or desire.</p>

            <div class="content">
                <p>Oh no! We really want to help you book your next adventure. Online 
				payments through our booking engine might be unsuccessful due to internet 
				connection issues, incorrect payment details or insufficient funds. If your
				payment is still not going through after you've reviewed all the above,
